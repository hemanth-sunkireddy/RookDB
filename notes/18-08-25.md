B - kernel implementation of page/disk block-oriented file access - page by page.

- If DBMS manages its chunk of pages then -
  - Data structures are created to store different page types in our **Storage Engine**.
  - A buffer pool is built to manage these pages.
  - The server requests data from disk through OS file system operations.
  - We create files and directories in the disk - We call OS to get the data from this files using file system.
